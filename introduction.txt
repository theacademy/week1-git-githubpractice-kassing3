Hello! My name is Korinna, and I'm currently pursuing a career as a Software Engineer. I recently completed a Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp with Rutgers University. I'm familiar with languages and methods such as JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, Bootstrap, SQL, and more. I'm excited to learn Java and advance my skills.
